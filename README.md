# Password-Generator
In this challenge I had to build a password generator. I left some notes about how the new stuff I leanered works. I couldn't figure how to put all of the characters in the same array, so i made different ones for each. Some stuff I had to get answers from Google , Youtube , Reddit and MDN to understand where to even begin with this project.

I think I got all of the Acceptance Criteria that was asked for. I did change the css a little to give it my own touch.
