# Password-Generator
In this challenge I had to build a password generator.I left ssome notes about how of the new stuff I leanered works. I couldn't figure how to put all of the characters in the same array, so i made different ones for each. Some stuff i had to get answers from Google , Youtube , Reddit and MDN to understand where to eve begin with this project.

I think i got all of the Acceptance Criteria that was asked for. I did change the css a little to give it my own touch.
